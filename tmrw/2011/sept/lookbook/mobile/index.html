                New York-based French transplant Alice Ritter designs a contemporary collection 
                that perfectly blends elements of French chic with New York’s laid-back approach 
                to style. Feminine and delicate details share the stage with sharply tailored and 
                more masculine lines to conjure up the image of an elegant, stylish and free- 
                spirited woman.
                 <br /><br />
                When Alice moved to New York from Paris over a decade ago, fashion was only 
                a passion for the former music publicist. She got her first order while making one- 
                of-a-kind hand-made pieces, which gave her the motivation to push the 
                adventure further. Few years of hard work and determination garnered Alice 
                Ritter the recognition she needed form the industry: supportive press, sponsored 
                fashion shows, loyal customers and more recently (February 2010) a place on 
                the CFDA Fashion Incubator Program.

                Introducing ANAGRAM, a new capsule collection from New York designer Gary
                Graham for Spring 2011. ANAGRAM captures a youthful and confident viewpoint: 20
                pieces created in 100-percent natural washed silks, cottons and hand-knits that can be
                mixed and arranged in various combinations for a complete yet multifarious wardrobe.<br /><br />
                The ANAGRAM woman is young, intelligent, intrepid and playful, a person who shops
                at a lower price point but values original and versatile pieces. The palette reflects this
                woman and is equally conversant, with a range of subtle yet refined tones. Together, the
                pieces are a manifestation of her many moods: from sophisticated Victorian to pagan
                rocker to witty party girl. This is an edited yet expanded vision of Gary Graham, an
                opportunity to share the designer’s breadth of view with a wider, burgeoning audience.
                ANAGRAM is Gary Graham, rearranged and viewed with new eyes.

Choonmoo Park has been at the forefront of Korean avant garde design since 1988, when she launched her label DEMOO.  Subsequently, she launched her eponymous line, PARKCHOONMOO.  Responding to high demand, the designer opened her first retail store in 1988 in trendy Apgujungdong (Korea) and expanded quickly into other Asian markets.  Since then, her designs have become iconic of a modern, architectural and yet fluid style.  Underlying her edgy but wearable designs is an artistic sensibility and superb fit derived from couture roots translated into ready-to-wear.  Park favors the striking impact of monotones such as black and white, punctuated by counterpoints of color, and layering to create new combinations that have become a signature of the PARKCHOONMOO aesthetic.<br /><br />

           ERRO. In Latin, the word means “stray.” To stray, to deviate, to wander. Launched in 2009, ERRO by Anna Larson creates clothing for such wanderers urban warriors who are effortlessly cool, restless with energy and keen to veer off the beaten path. 
<br /><br />
As she debuts her fourth ERRO season, Larson continues to evolve the line, integrating new signatures, such as corsetry and cut-out details, and finding fresh paths toward functionality, such as developing garments with detachable elements, or snap details that adapt fit. At the heart of it all, of course, is Larson’s drive to redefine luxury for a new generation of women. Street-smart, daring, with a modern sense of elegance, the ERRO woman is going places. Wherever she winds up, ERRO is her wardrobe.

           Juniper Rose is the designer behind Falconiere, a line of armored accessories she launched in 2009 following a successful capsule collection for Donna Karan Resort.  Inspired by the young adult medieval fantasy novel she began writing; Falconiere is named for the falconers who trained birds to hunt during the middle ages.  As the name implies, the decadent chain-mail epaulets that hang off the shoulder and chest pieces that are constructed like camisoles command attention.

           J Apostrophe’s Fall/Winter collection aims to bring harmony by collaging and mixing contradicting elements. The main concept of this collection is to bring out harmony, normally unexpected from a mix and match of elements that usually do not go well with one another. This collection’s design is derived from artificial elements such as man-made structures, resulting in contained and controlled silhouette, but with details that are irregular yet geometrical. The contracting binary elements of this collection are well represented in the clutch bag. The clutch bag matches two types of leather that are completely different in texture, creating aesthetic appeal, but also carries practicality, with handles that would normally be associated with casual handbags.

           After a vivid dream in the night, designer Juliana Bennett awoke with a detailed vision for Mulcair’s Spring/Summer 2012 collection: A tall sail-ship floats along the dark waters, its uniformed crew illuminated by brilliant flashes of lightning, and at the center of it all, our fearlessly chic heroine, her pet cheetah, and their nautical misadventure! For the collection A Dream in the Night, Mulcair takes its tomboy chic, military-inspired aesthetic on a playful journey at sea, and this time, the cheetah is loose! <br /><br />

This season’s color palette finds its character in a naval haberdashery of old; subtle navy suiting and airy black mesh balance with light grey, sand, denim and midnight blue. Gold shank buttons sparkle alongside luxurious leathers and grosgrain trims while playful strips of cheetah sprint alongside masculine striped shirting. Other lush materials include Moroccan crepes, crepe de chine, voile, dalvik suiting and mud silk.
