                <div class="desc-lg"><p><strong>ENK International, LLC Privacy Policy</strong><br>
                  ENK International, LLC respects and protects the privacy of everyone who accesses our websites, applications and systems. We will not intentionally disclose individually identifiable information about our customers, members or visitors to any third party without specific consent or prior notice to our users. <br>
                  <br>
                  This notice describes how ENK International, LLC collects, uses and discloses information about you when you subscribe to our services and you visit our web sites. By visiting sites offered by ENK International, LLC, you are accepting the practices described in this notice. <br>
                  <br>
                  ENK International, LLC will not disclose any of your personal information, except as described below; when we believe, in good faith, that the law requires it; or to protect the rights or property of ENK International, LLC. ENK International, LLC does disclose aggregated user statistics (for example, 45% of our users are interested in specific areas of interest) in order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes. <br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>Personal Information</strong><br>
                  At times, we may ask for personal contact information. This may include your name, e-mail address, and other personal information when you sign up for our services by filling out online forms. We may also ask for such information at other times, such as when you request information or enter areas with restricted access.<br>
                  <br>
                  We will use this information to help customize your site experience or to facilitate communication between you and the individuals or partners, associates, advertisers, and other third parties (collectively "partners") participating in our site. ENK International, LLC may also collect IP addresses to report aggregate information to our advertisers and others and for the purposes of system administration. You will be prompted to supply us with this information when registering for The WSA Show.<br>
                  <br>
                  Additionally, if you elect to contact our partners or make a purchase from our sites, the information obtained during your visit to these areas, and the information that you give such as your credit card number and contact information, is provided to the person of record. These can be ENK International, LLC or third party companies. These companies have separate privacy and data collection practices. ENK International, LLC has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies. <br>
                  <br>
                  Registration - The WSA Show<br>
                  By knowing a little about you, ENK International, LLC is able to deliver more relevant content and advertisements, and hence a better service, to you. ENK International, LLC's goal in collecting personal information is to provide you, the user, with the most intuitive Web experience possible. In addition, we provide our advertisers with an efficient means to reach the right audience.<br>
                  <br>
                  In our role of delivering targeted advertisements, ENK International, LLC displays advertisements to users meeting criteria provided by the advertiser. In this process, the advertiser never has access to individual account information. Only ENK International, LLC has access to individuals' accounts. <br>
                  <br>
                  You do not need to register to take advantage of many of the features and benefits offered at The WSA Show website. However, in order to access and enable all benefits of this website, you will be required to register. The registration process involves the selection of a username and password contact information and certain details related to your business. This information will constitute your user profile. The password-protected areas of this Web site can only be accessed with a valid password. You are responsible for keeping your password secret and confidential, and for notifying us if you believe that your password has been stolen or might otherwise be misused.<br>
                  <br>
                  Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for example by submitting online forms, participating in discussion groups, or through e-mail - your information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. When you join a private e-mail group online, that group's mailing list may be disclosed to the third-party administrator. Consequently, unless you remove yourself from that list via a link made available to users, you may receive unsolicited messages from the other parties. <br>
                  <br>
                  Some of your information may be aggregated into summary reports for use in marketing The WSA Show to other users and potential advertisers. Under confidentiality agreements, ENK International, LLC may match user information with third party data. If and when we do match user information, we endeavor to keep personal information confidential from those third parties. <br>
                  <br>
                  Furthermore, while we strive to protect your personal information, ENK International, LLC cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. In addition, ENK International, LLC and our partners or other third party Internet sites and services accessible through ENK International, LLC or parties whom we inform you are collecting data in connection with sweepstakes, promotions, etc., have separate privacy and data collection practices, independent of us. ENK International, LLC has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or actions. In addition, in connection with the sale or transfer of the business (in whole or in part), such information may be sold or transferred to the purchaser of the business. <br>
                  <br>
                  You may edit or change your profile at any time by logging into The WSA Show. If you wish to terminate your registration and delete your personal information, please send an email a written request to customerservice@wsashow.com.<br>
