<strong>ENK International, LLC Privacy Policy</strong><br>

ENK International, LLC (together with its divisions, subsidiaries and affiliates, “ENK,” “we” or “us”) operates this website, <a href="www.enkshows.com">www.enkshows.com</a> (the “Site”). ENK recognizes that you care how information about you is used and shared.  We created this Privacy Policy to inform you of our information collection, use and sharing practices for this Site.

<br/><br/>
BY USING THE SITE, YOU AGREE TO THE COLLECTION, STORAGE AND USE OF YOUR INFORMATION BY US IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY, DO NOT USE THIS SITE.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Information We Collect</strong><br/>
In general, you may visit the Site without identifying yourself or revealing any personal information.
<br/><br/>
We may collect certain other, non-personally identifiable information, automatically when you visit and interact with this Site.  For example, we may collect and store your IP address, website browsing patterns, reference site domain name, and demographic information.  We also may collect information regarding customer traffic patterns and site usage.  Such information is collected through the use of "cookies," which are text files that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive.  These cookies are set to your computer when you register or submit online forms.
<br/><br/>
Some portions of the Site may require you to give us personally-identifiable information such as your name, job title, company, physical mailing address, e-mail address, telephone and fax numbers (collectively, “Personal Information”) and, if applicable, financial information such as your credit card, billing or other payment information (collectively, “Financial Information”), to, among other things: (i) register for attendance at certain ENK trade shows, conferences and events; (ii) obtain access to certain online content and functionality; and (iii) subscribe to our publications. If you communicate with us by e-mail, post messages to any of our chat groups, bulletin boards or forums, or otherwise complete online forms, surveys or contest entries, any information provided in such communications may be collected as Personal Information.
<br/><br/>
<strong>How We Use Your Information</strong><br/>
If you elect to provide us with Personal Information, we use it primarily to deliver the service you requested.  We also may use Personal Information to contact you about sales, special offers and new Site features, unless you have opted not to receive promotional communications.
<br/><br/>
If you submit Financial Information, we use that information primarily to verify your credit and collect payments for your purchases, orders, registrations etc.
<br/><br/>
The non-personally identifiable information we collect through the use of cookies is used to improve this Site and to customize your browsing experience when you visit the Site by providing your browser with information tailored to your preferences and needs.  For example, cookies allow us to: (i) identify your computer and automatically access your account information, (ii) facilitate your navigation of the Site, (iii) measure Site usage to specific areas (and this data may be aggregated with usage data from all Site visitors), and (iv) maintain information about your use of this Site.  Most browsers accept cookies automatically but allow you to disable them.  We recommend that you leave the cookies enabled so that you can receive a more personalized browsing experience when visiting this Site.
<br/><br/>
We may use advertising companies to develop banner ads for our website.  These ads may contain cookies.  These companies collect cookies sent to your browser through the banner ads and we do not have control of, or access to, this data.
<br/><br/>
<strong>How We May Share Your Information</strong><br/>
Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, we do not share with, rent or sell to others any Personal Information or Financial Information that you provide to us through this Site.
<br/><br/>
We may share non-personally identifiable information, in an aggregated form, with third parties from time to time to illustrate trends and patterns or when we believe such third parties’ products or services may be of interest to you.
<br/><br/>
We use third party contractors, such as Velocity, Travel Planners and VizKit.com, Inc., to help us operate our business and the Site and to administer activities on our behalf.  We may share your information, with these contractors as needed for those limited purposes.
<br/><br/>
We may also disclose your information when we determine it is necessary to comply with applicable laws or to protect the rights, property or safety of ENK, our business partners, visitors to the Site, or others.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Not For Children</strong><br/>
As a business-to-business company, we do not knowingly collect information from children. On-line registration and web site usage is restricted to adults who are professionally engaged in the businesses we serve. 
<br/><br/>
<strong>Exceptions</strong><br/>
If ENK sells some or all of its assets to, or merges with, another company, or declares bankruptcy, or the Site is acquired by another company, information collected from you, including Personal Information and Financial Information, may be sold or transferred to a third party as a result of the transfer of assets.  Nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to interfere with our ability to transfer all or part of our business and/or assets to an affiliate or independent third party at any time, for any purpose, without any limitation whatsoever.  We specifically reserve the right to transfer or share a copy of Personal Information and Financial Information collected from this Site, or otherwise, to the buyer of that portion of our business relating to that information.
<br/><br/>
Whenever you voluntarily make your personal information available for viewing by third parties online - for example in chat rooms or on message boards - ENK has no ability or obligation to prevent third-party access to such information and ENK undertakes no responsibility to keep such information private.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Security [and Encryption]</strong><br/>
Protecting your information is important to us, and we take commercially reasonable precautions to protect your information. We use SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption technology on the portions of our website that accept Financial Information between your browser and our server. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  As a result, while we are committed to protecting your information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Opt Out</strong><br/>
If you do not want to receive promotional communications from us, please click on the "unsubscribe" hyperlink contained in promotional emails we send you.  It is possible that you may continue to receive promotional communications from us some time after your request to opt out because distribution lists are often prepared in advance of an offering.  We appreciate your patience and understanding in giving us time to fulfill your request.  Should you accept promotional emails from us, any email you receive will include instructions on how to be removed from ENK's email distribution lists.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Your California Privacy Rights</strong><br/>
California's "Shine the Light" law, Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.83, permits visitors to the Site who are residents of California to request and obtain from us, once per year, free of charge, information about the Personal Information and Financial Information, if any, that we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year.  If applicable, this information includes a listing of the categories of personal information that was shared, and the names and addresses of the third parties with whom we shared the information.
<br/><br/>
If you are a California resident, and would like to make such a request, please submit your request, in writing, to:
